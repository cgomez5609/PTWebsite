    testimonial: "Deborah is a great trainer and motivator. Before working with \
    her I knew I had bad habits. After her personal fitness training and nutrition \
    counseling, I had all the tools I needed to break them. Deborah taught me how \
    to eat more nutritionally-fulfilling foods and gave me a much-needed foundation \
    for dynamic workouts that supplement my running. I would recommend Deb to anyone \
    who needs a jumpstart into a healthier lifestyle.",

    testimonial: "After trying many different personal trainers I gave up exercising all \
    together. Each time, I was dissapointed in their lack of knowledge and their ego trips. \
    I told them I had bad knees and could not do lunges or squats...and believe it or \
    not...that was the first thing they had me do. Then I met Deborah. I have been working \
    with Deborah for 8 years and her gentle, yet effective approach has resulted in my \
    increased strength and healthier lifestyle. Deborah goes at MY speed, not hers, and \
    her awesome sense of humor and down-to-earth attitude has kept me a client for this \
    long...3 days a week...for 8 years. Give yourself the ultimate gift...and hire Deborah \
    to get you in shape...the RIGHT way.",

    testimonial: "I feel great! Before Deb, I’d been on so many diets. What she taught me was \
    truly life changing. When I started working with her my blood sugar was up to 200, but \
    within four weeks I got my diabetes under control and my numbers down to 89… promising \
    signs that I might be able to get off my medications! I’ve lost so much weight that at my \
    last doctor’s visit, all the nurses wanted to know my secret and I was more than delighted \
    to share my Deborah experience.",

    testimonial: "I love Deb! She is super positive and extremely encouraging \
    and I really look forward to seeing her every week. Deb not only keeps me \
    on track physically, but gives me great advice about my eating habits and \
    food choices, balances it all with tons of smart shopping tips. Training \
    with Deb is a like getting a physical fitness, food education and therapy \
    session all rolled into one.",

    testimonial: "Like lots of people, my New Year’s resolution was to get healthier. \
    I joined the West Loop Athletic Club and took advantage of its introductory personal \
    training offer. From our first meet, I knew I wanted to work with Deb. I loved her \
    outlook on training and nutrition and her amazing enthusiasm. She’s taught me so much \
    about food and clean eating and the education doesn’t stop. She continually makes \
    suggestions so I don’t get bored with the foods I eat. And, because I travel a lot \
    for work, she’s taught me how to stay on track - even at restaurants. In the gym, \
    she challenges me to do things I never would have attempted on my own or thought \
    I’d be capable of and it feels amazing.  I’m proud to say that within the first \
    6 months of working with Deb I lost 25 pounds and 17 ¼ inches. I couldn’t have done \
    it without her! I have more work to do but with Deb in my corner I know I’ll achieve \
    my goals and when I do, I’m not sure who will be prouder – me or Deb. It’s a real \
    motivator working with someone who cares so deeply and celebrates my success as \
    much as I do. That kind of support is priceless.",

    testimonial: "For years, my wife tried to get me to workout but I’d joined enough gyms \
    to know that I’d be a dues-paying, no-show in no time. Then my wife starting training \
    with Deb and couldn’t stop raving about her – that and, well, the results were undeniable, \
    so I decided to give Deb a shot. From the get-go, I was hooked. Deb is absolutely amazing! \
    I came to her with a bum shoulder and bad knees and was on blood pressure, diabetes and \
    cholesterol meds. In no time she had me doing squats, planks and burpees – all while she \
    counseled me on how to further improve my health by eating better. Six months later, I’m \
    still at it. I’ve lost three inches around my waste and have built up my chest, shoulders, \
    arms and legs to the point where I don’t care to build more muscle. But more importantly, \
    I’m pain-free and my doctor reduced my meds by half. Now my goal is to get entirely off the \
    meds and with Deb in my corner, I’m confident I can do it.",
