This was a website I created for a friends that is in the fitness industry. I used the javascript library React. To see this version go to https://cgomez5609.github.io/ and for the final published version on the web go to http://foodprintforlife.com/. <br>
There are minor differences between the two, but the final version was created using vanilla javascript and django for the backend.
